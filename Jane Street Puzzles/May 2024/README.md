# May 2024 Jane Street Puzzle - "Number Cross 4"

This directory contains my attempt at solving the **May 2024 Jane Street Puzzle**. Unfortunately, I lost both the final version of my solution and the code due to not yet using GitHub properly. However, I've included images of the final grid and my latest saved attempt, to showcase and document my progress.

### Explanation of the Challenge

The puzzle presented a grid with various numerical constraints based on mathematical properties (such as squares, Fibonacci numbers, palindromes, etc.), and the objective was to fill the grid with digits that satisfied all these conditions. I made considerable progress, but I ran into issues when trying to resolve conflicting constraints like the "sum of digits is 7" and "multiple of 37."

### Lost Code

Unfortunately, I lost the code that accompanied this solution as I hadn’t yet started using GitHub properly. If I had saved the code, I could have automated the testing of different digit combinations, which would have sped up the process and likely led to a correct solution.

### Future Improvements

If I revisit this puzzle, I would:
- Implement a systematic approach for testing and verifying all constraints.
- Take extra care in handling edge cases, especially around primes, palindromes, and multiples.
- Ensure I’m saving my progress properly to avoid losing code and final solutions.
- Properly test solution to not have work done in vain
