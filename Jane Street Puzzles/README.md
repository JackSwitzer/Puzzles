## Solutions

### Successful Solutions
Below are my successful submissions to the Jane Street Puzzles:

### Failed / Incomplete Solutions
In this section, you’ll find puzzles that I attempted but didn’t fully solve or where I failed to complete the challenge successfully. Each directory contains my work and a brief explanation of what went wrong.

- **[May 2024](https://github.com/JackSwitzer/Jane-Street-Puzzles/tree/main/May%202024)**  
  - Status: **Failed**
  - Explanation: I made significant progress on the May 2024 puzzle but was unable to arrive at a correct solution. Final code has been lost (prior to me using github fulltime)
  - Reasoning: I only tested a limited number of primes raised to prime powers due to percieved computational limitations. This resulted in my not having the actual solution in my search space (which I thought was wide enough), thus causing me to miss the correct solution and instead submitting a prime number (raised to 1) which in retrospection of course Jane Street would know 1 isn't a prime even though it's a common misconception
  - Otherwise my solution was fully correct, however almost correct isn't good enough

### To Be Determined (TBD)
Upcoming puzzles or those I am still working on will be placed here until I either solve them or categorize them as successful or failed.

- **[October 2024](https://github.com/JackSwitzer/Jane-Street-Puzzles/tree/main/October%202024)**
